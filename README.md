**Mail Spam Detection and Classifier**
**Overview**
This project implements a machine learning model to detect and classify spam emails. By analyzing the content of emails, the system can effectively distinguish between legitimate messages (ham) and spam. The project utilizes data preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF vectorization, logistic regression for classification, and model evaluation to ensure accuracy and robustness.

**Features**
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and encoding labels.
Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.
Model Training: Training a logistic regression model.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance on training and test data.
Prediction: Classifying new email inputs as spam or ham.
**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is a CSV file named mail_data.csv which contains email messages and their corresponding labels ('spam' or 'ham').
